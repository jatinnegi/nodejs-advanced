Once you've understood the fundamentals of the asynchronous patterns described
in this chapter, you shouldn't rely on the simplified implementations presented here
for your everyday control flow needs. Instead, it's better to adopt a broadly used and
battle-tested library like async for your production applications, unless your use case
is so advanced that you require a custom algorithm.
