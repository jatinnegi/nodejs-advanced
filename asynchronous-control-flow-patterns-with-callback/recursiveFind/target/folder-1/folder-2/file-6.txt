The async library (not to be confused with the async/await keywords, which we will
discuss later in this book) is a very popular solution, in Node.js and JavaScript in
general, for dealing with asynchronous code. It offers a set of functions that greatly
simplify the execution of tasks in different configurations, and it also provides useful
helpers for dealing with collections asynchronously. Even though there are several
other libraries with a similar goal, async is the de facto standard in Node.js due to its
historic popularity, especially when using callbacks to define asynchronous tasks.
